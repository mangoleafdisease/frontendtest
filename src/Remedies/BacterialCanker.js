    <i>Bacterial canker is a disease caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris, which affects mangotrees. On the leaves, bacterial canker manifests as small, water-soaked spots that can enlarge andbecome necrotic (dead) over time. As the disease progresses, the infected leaves may yellowandfall off, and the tree may defoliate. Here are some effective remedies to control bacterial canker on mangoleaves: </i>
    <br/> <br/>
    ðŸ—¸ Sanitation: Maintaining good sanitation practices is key to preventing the spread of bacterial canker. Remove and dispose of infected leaves, twigs, and branches to reduce the spreadof thedisease.
    <br/> <br/>
    ðŸ—¸ Pruning: Regular pruning of infected twigs and branches can help prevent the spread of thedisease. Make sure to sterilize pruning tools between cuts to avoid spreading the bacteria fromone plant to another.
    <br/> <br/>
    ðŸ—¸ Water management: Avoid overhead irrigation and allow the foliage to dry off between waterings to reduce the spread of the disease.
    <br/> <br/>
    ðŸ—¸ Antibiotic treatment: In severe cases, a copper-based bactericide or an antibiotic like streptomycin can be applied to control the spread of the disease. Always followthe label instructions for application rates and frequencies.
    <br/> <br/>
    ðŸ—¸ Resistant varieties: Choose mango varieties that are resistant to bacterial canker, such as `Alphonso` and `Kesar.`
    <br/> <br/>
    ðŸ—¸ Crop rotation: Rotating mango trees with crops like soybeans or sorghum can help reducethepopulation of bacteria in the soil.
    <br/> <br/>
    <i>It's important to implement a combination of these remedies to effectively control bacterial canker onmango leaves. Additionally, it's always a good idea to consult with a local agriculture extension officeor a plant disease specialist for specific recommendations for your area.</i>
