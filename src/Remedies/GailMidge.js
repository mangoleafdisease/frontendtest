    <i>Gall midge is a pest that affects mango trees. It is a small, reddish-brown fly that lays its eggs on thenewgrowth of mango leaves. When the eggs hatch, the larvae feed on the leaf tissue, causing the formationof galls or raised, swollen areas on the leaves. These galls can cause the affected leaves to becomedistorted and curled, and in severe cases, the leaves may fall off. Here are some effective remedies tocontrol gall midge on mango leaves:</i>
